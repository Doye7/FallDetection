Javax.Mail is a library provided by Java for
	emailing. It is not written by me and is
	not to be considered.

GoogleMailSend contains the source code for sending
	emails. Open with Netbeans for the raw project or the 
	source file GoogleMailSend.java with prefered editing program. Consists of
	a single class with 2 functions and no main.

Ensure javax.mail is able to be imported.
